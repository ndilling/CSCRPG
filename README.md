main.py code/program is the main program you will be running. Every other file is loaded or brought into this main.py file to be used accordingly. Such as the character creation modules and the screens.

We suggest running this game on a personal computer as opposed to a school computer.

Make sure pygame, json, matplotlib, and OS are installed on your personal computer / imported. Make sure to install and run your file from the Terminal.

Hit "n" for a new game / to start game. Choose any of the 5 options that are presented.

Stats overview: You may cboose whatever stats you want Fighter: focus on strength and constitution Paladin: focus on strength and constitution Sorcerer: focus on intelligence and constitution Cleric: focus on strength and constitution Ranger: focus on strength and constitution #You may choose whatever you want these are just tips to make game more balanced Use all 20 points then hit confirm when ready

You have two options for abilities Sometimes there will be a countdown for when you use an ability. This is a cooldown timer, it will countdown based on terms. (Can't use the move for a certain period of time) Go through hitting abilities till you win. There are many options but this is for the user to pick and have fun with. Play around however you want, some classes have healing abilities and such. Every class has different spells or abilities and you should try each one as they offer a very different experience.

There is hover over on all abilities. This will tell you what they do and the stuff they can do.

A lot of this is self explanatory and can be figured out by the user / player. You may lose if you play badly, but you should hopefully win the game.

Good luck adventurer!
